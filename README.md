This productivity-focused Chrome Extension is designed to help users mitigate distractions by restricting access to non-work-related tabs. By leveraging HTML and JavaScript event listeners, the extension detects when users attempt to access distracting tabs and redirects them to a looping cat video, encouraging them to remain focused on their work.

## Features

- Restricts access to non-work-related tabs
- Utilizes event listeners to detect tab access attempts
- Redirects users to a looping cat video to encourage focus

## Installation

To install the extension, follow these steps:

1. Download the extension files from the repository.
2. Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable Developer Mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the downloaded extension files.

## How It Works

Once installed, the extension runs in the background of Chrome. It monitors tab access attempts and triggers redirection to the cat video when users try to access non-work-related tabs. This gentle reminder encourages users to stay focused on their tasks.

## Usage

Simply install the extension and let it run in the background while you work. If you attempt to access a distracting tab, you will be redirected to the cat video. Enjoy the adorable distraction while regaining focus on your work.
